# 8086 Instruction Decoder

This project is an 8086 instruction decoder designed to disassemble the instructions found in the following file:

[listing_0038_many_register_mov](https://github.com/cmuratori/computer_enhance/blob/main/perfaware/part1/listing_0038_many_register_mov)

## Overview

The 8086 instruction decoder takes binary machine code and translates it into human-readable assembly language instructions. This tool is specifically tailored to handle the instructions present in the `listing_0038_many_register_mov` file from the Computer Enhance project by Casey Muratori.

## Features

- Decodes 8086 machine code instructions
- Outputs human-readable assembly language
- Supports a wide range of 8086 instructions

## Usage

To use the decoder, simply provide the binary machine code as input, and the decoder will output the corresponding assembly language instructions.
